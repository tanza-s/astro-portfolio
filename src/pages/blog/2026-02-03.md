# Digging In
Published 2026-02-03

Welcome to my _test page_ made using the Astro docs Build a Blog tutorial.

## What I've done so far

1. **Installed Astro**: I created a new Astro project using the Portfolio template.

2. **Customized images and text**: I updated the information in the template to my own content

3. **Make a blog post page**: Make the blog page render.
