In anticipation of an interview i have tomorrow morning, I am going to be building out a simple application that uses the Astro framework in the frontend. The organization I am applying to uses a CMS in the backend, but this project will only contain the client side of the application.

It's been a while since I learned how to code. 2018 was a very different time in many ways, but there's an odd irony to its similarities. A turning point in the country, paired with a personal turning point that I'm not going to get into here. Just know that I was quite comfortable until circumstances out of my control forced me to shift gears. I'm doing that again, 8 years later. 

There's something comforting about turning my attention to a new skill. I've found that studying without the pressure of grades and testing is an enjoyable activity. It helps me feel like the time I'm spending will actually build towards something. Reward in proportion to time invested, what a concept!

Anyways, it's late and it's been a long day. I have to be eager enough in the morning to hold an intelligent conversation, so it's time to sleep.
