					<p>
						I'm a full-stack developer with seven years of experience
						building and maintaining web platforms for arts institutions.
						At California College of the Arts, I've been the sole developer
						responsible for both the public-facing cca.edu website and an internal
						Portal serving 2,000+ users, working primarily with React,
						Django/Wagtail, and Google Cloud Platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before I learned to code, I was a painter. I studied fine arts at Stanford
						and continue to maintain an active studio practice alongside my development
						work. This combination gives me a different perspective on
						technical problems. I approach technological solutions like creative projects,
						with attention to craft, composition, and impact.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've led major projects including a React 16 to 19 migration, a modular Wagtail
						CMS homepage redesign, and the integration of third-party tools like Vev
						(which earned an SF Design Week award for our DEIB page).
						I also helped build the 2020 Graduating Students Showcase during a
						particularly challenging year for arts education.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of development, I'm a curator and organizer. I recently curated
						"Murmurations: Self-Portraits by Artists of Diaspora," a 31-artist exhibition
						at Sentro Filipino, and I'm involved in workplace advocacy through the
						CCA Staff Union and SEIU Local 1021. I also maintain a consistent creative practice
						featuring vivid paintings and mixed media soft sculpture.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm currently looking for my next role, ideally with a mission-driven organization in the arts,
						design, or creative technology space where I can continue building tools that
						support creative communities.
